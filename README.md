# About TakeHomeWeatherApp
This is a simple UI weather app that allows the user to insert a zip code and get the current temperature of the specified area and also get more details in once you click on a city.

## My Experience
I want to thank -un-named person/group- for this opportunity. I gave it my all on this project, it does not look like much but a lot of work went into it. I enjoy the challenge of learning something new like unit testing and being able to use it on this app. This app took me a couple of days to make because I made so many mistakes and learned on the way, I fought with my self and doubted my self if I can even come out with a working app but in the end, I did it. No matter the result of this application, what I have learned making this app made me a better developer. I still have to do some more testing but I am happy with the current version.
